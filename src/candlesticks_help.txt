This package creates so called candlestick plots. See here for examples:
http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_5.4/finance.html

Candlesticks are used to plot financial data. The height of the candlestick is the difference between the opening and closing price, and is called "body". Above and below the body are the "shadows" that indicate the maximum and minimum price at observation t. If the opening price is lower than the closing price, the body is white or green. If the opening price is higher than the closing price, the body is black or red. For more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart

The dataset must be cross-sectinal or time-series. If one of the passed series includes missing values for the t-th observation, this observation is ignored for plotting.

Please ask questions and report bugs on the gretl mailing list if possible. Alternatively, create an issue ticket on the github repo (see below).
Source code and test script(s) can be found here:

Usage via the GUI
=================
As a user you can either call the main function via scripting (see below) or
the GUI. The menu entry is "View->Graph specified vars->Candlesticks plot".
The user has to pass a list with series in expected order: Open, Close, High,
Low. An optionally last item can refer to trade volume.

If you pass the optional 5th volume series, this is shown in a separate chart below the candlestick plot.

Via scripting the user can control many more details as shown below.
