This package creates so called candlestick plots. See here for examples:
http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_5.4/finance.html

Candlesticks are used to plot financial data. The width of the candlestick is the difference between the opening and closing price, and is called "body". Above and below the body are the "shadows" that indicate the maximum and minimum price at observation t. If the opening price is lower than the closing price, the body is white or green. If the opening price is higher than the closing price, the body is black or red. For more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart

The data frequency must be a time-series with daily observations (5, 6 or 7 days week). If one of the passed series includes missing values for the t-th observation, this observation is ignored for plotting.

Please ask questions and report bugs on the gretl mailing list if possible. Alternatively, create an issue ticket on the github repo (see below).
